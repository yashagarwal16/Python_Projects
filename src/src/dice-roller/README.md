# ðŸŽ² Fun Dice Roller  

Welcome to ***Fun Dice Roller***, a simple yet exciting Python program that lets you roll a pair of diceâ€”just like in a real board game! ðŸŽ²

## Whatâ€™s This About?  

Ever wanted to roll some dice without actually having them? This program simulates rolling two six-sided dice. Just type **'y'** to roll and **'n'** to quitâ€”easy, right?  

##  How to Get Started  
No complicated setup, just follow these steps:  

1. **Make sure Python is installed** (Python 3 is recommended).  
2. **Download or copy the script** and save it as `dice_roller.py`.  
3. **Run it in your terminal** by typing:  

   ```bash
   python dice_roller.py
   ```

4. **Have fun rolling!** ðŸŽ²

## ðŸŽ® How It Works  
- Youâ€™ll be asked: **"Roll the dice? (y/n): "**  
- If you type **'y'**, two dice will roll, and youâ€™ll get random numbers between 1 and 6.  
- If you type **'n'**, the game will say **"Thanks for playing!"** and exit.  
- Any other input? The program will gently remind you to enter a valid choice.  

## ðŸ“¸ What It Looks Like  
```
Roll the dice? (y/n): y
(4, 2)

Roll the dice? (y/n): y
(6, 5)

Roll the dice? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?  
Thinking of leveling up this project? Here are some cool ideas:  
ðŸ”¹ Add different dice types (D4, D8, D20, etc.)  
ðŸ”¹ Create a graphical version with animations ðŸŽ¨  
ðŸ”¹ Keep a history of previous rolls
